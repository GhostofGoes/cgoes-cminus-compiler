# Cgoes Cminus Compiler (CCC)
A compiler for Robert Heckendorn's C- (cminus) language. 

## Usage
```
    ./c- <inputfile> [flags]
    tm <objectfile>.tm
```

## Flags
```
-d      Enable yydebug for flex/bison debugging
-t      Testing flag, for general debugging
-p      Print the syntax tree generated by bison
-P      Print the annotated syntax tree (annotated with types, etc)
-o [ <filename> | - ]  Generate TM instructions. 
(Default: "fred.tm". <filename>: outputs to the filename. '-': stdout)
```

# Using the CCC
## Environment requirements
    Bison 3.0 or higher (Hard requirement, can confirm 2.5 freaks out)
    Flex 2.5.39 or higher (I think flex 2.5.37 will work as well)
    gcc 4.9 or higher (Hard requirement, C++11)
    make 4.0 (Most any version will work fine)

## Quickstart guide
    git clone <repo>
    cd <repo>/src
    make tm # Makes the Tiny Machine emulator
    make    # Makes CCC
    ./c- 6tests/scope35.c- -P -o scope35.tm
    tm scope35.c-
    g
