Does C- have a heap?

changing ordering of operators changes emitted code.

(sdiff command )

scheme
	put answer in register 3 (of a instruction)
	IF statement example: test is a expression, results of expression goes in register 3, so we check register 3 for the IF statement
	when return, take stuff from register 3 and put into register 2
	

(most compilers operate with infinite number of registers, then allocate all at the end? NP-complete optimization problems lol)
