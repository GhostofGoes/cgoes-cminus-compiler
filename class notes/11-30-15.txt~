11/30 Notes
Foreach implementation example
************

C- foreach is very pythonic.

Example
foreachScalar( int x, y)
{
	int p, limit;
	p = 0;
	limit = y;
	while(p < limit)
	{
		x = p;
		<do some action>;
		p++;
	}
}

Array version is almost identical, just with array pointers.

Need to make sure break works still!

(have a switch to emit comments/not emit comments)

come to foreach node, replace with tree that contains while code and all the foreach stuff, in C-. So then the code generator will come through and process it. (basically, a post-semantic macro)

(idea: write a tree-parsing function, then write functions that are passed, and operate on the tree. keep context information in a datastructure. could use for printing, parsing, etc.)
(look at C++ books for how to do this)

(cast const char *'s as (char *) when passing to functions)
