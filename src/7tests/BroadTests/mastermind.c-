// Mind Master in C-
// Author: Frank Mitchell
// Date: 4 May 2006

// Instructions:

// Mind Master will first ask you for an integer. Go ahead & type in whatever
// you want here. It's just a seed for a PRNG. Then the game will start. Mind
// Master will secretly pick four numbers from 0 to 9, but it won't tell you
// what those numbers are. The name of the game is to guess the numbers Mind
// Master picked & the order it picked them in. Here's how the game's played.

// On each turn, Mind Master will output the number of the turn you're on. Then
// Mind Master will ask you for four numbers. These numbers should be between 0
// & 9 & they corresond to your guesses. Mind Master will then output two
// numbers. The first number is the number of correct guesses you had that were
// ! in the correct spot. The second number is the number of correct guesses you
// had that were in the correct spot. Then you get another turn. But be careful ! 
// You only get 20 turns, so use them wisely. With a bit of luck & logic, you
// should be able to figure out the numbers Mind Master picked & the order it
// picked them in.

// If you win, you'll see a row of T's. If you loose, you'll see a row of F's.
// Either way, Mind Master will show you the correct answer at the end. To quit
// the game prematurely (i.e. give up) just enter a negative number when Mind
// Master asks you for a guess.

// Good luck !
